# Dashboard
Basic dashboard made with D3.js and React. There is no build system to make this easy so here is a step by step guide to set this up.
### Getting Started
```
$ npm install
$ npm run watch
(open another terminal)
$ npm run build
$ npm start or npm run debug
You can now find the dashboard on port 3000
```
